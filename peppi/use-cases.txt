File:
    Properties:
        * Know total file size from metadata (speculative)
        * Can seek
        * If reading, generally fastest to read whole file into slice
Stream:
    Properties:
        * Can only seek event by event
        * 
Live-file:
    Properties:
        * Possible instability from dolphin writes
        * User might try to pass it as a 'file' despite being unfinished
        * Will have EOF
* with file skip frames
* with stream return stream of events


===============
Interface:

parse_all(slice) -> Iterator<EventReader>
skip_frames(File, fallback) -> {start, end, metadata}

======== 9/29/23
* Skim: game start, game end, metadata, (maybe: last frame)
* Parse All fast: (allocation with first pass)
* Feed: send chunks of data for incremental parsing
