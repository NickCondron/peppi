Criterion issues:
doc for `Criterion::bench_with_input()` doesn't do a good job of showing why you
would use it over just `bench_function()` or why it takes an id and
`bench_function()` just takes a string

wasn't immediately clear the difference between benchmark group and the macro 

docs for sample_size and measurement time describe the effect of the values,
but don't do a good job describing exactly what those values mean

iter_batched_mut code example is identical to iter_batched example
